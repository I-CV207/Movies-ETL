# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to apply the ETL process using data from different sources in order to create an automatic program that cleans the data with the given parameters.

  Through the use of tools, like DataFrames created from JSONs and CSVs, list comprehension and funtions this was possible. At the end, this program helps to create "clean files" that are easy to understand and to analyse.

  At the end it was possible to create a Database that has all the relevant information about every single movie, with the proper structure and data.
